/**
 * The app hands users static files out of `public/` — the Quick Reference Guide
 * PDF, favicons. Nothing holds the link and the file together: rename or drop
 * one of them and the build passes, ESLint passes, every type check passes, and
 * the link 404s in the user's face.
 *
 * This walks the source for root-relative asset hrefs and asserts each one
 * resolves. It is deliberately a source scan rather than a component render, so
 * it covers every link in the app rather than only the ones a test happens to
 * mount.
 *
 * Only root-relative literals are checked. External URLs (the TOS and Privacy
 * PDFs live on spertsuite.com) are out of scope — those are the landing page's
 * to serve, and asserting on them here would make this suite depend on a
 * different repository's deploy.
