/**
 * `LICENSE` is a suite-wide artifact copied by hand into nine repositories. The
 * canonical copy lives in the SPERT® Suite landing-page repository. Every line
 * is identical across all nine except line 4, which names that repo's URL.
 *
 * Hand-copying with nothing asserting conformance is exactly how it drifted
 * before, and this repository carried two of the defects: line 1 still read
 * `Statistical PERT® Software Suite`, a brand retired at the v1.4 rebrand in
 * March 2026, and the ADDITIONAL TERMS were an older, weaker wording that
 * omitted both the ban on *replacing* the author attribution and the
 * visible-UI-notice requirement. Elsewhere in the suite it was worse — GanttApp
 * shipped 48 lines and spert-cfd 64, neither carrying the GNU GPL v3 at all,
 * just a short notice and a gnu.org link. GPL §4 requires giving recipients a
 * copy of the licence; a link is a weak substitute.
 *
 * All nine were resynchronised on 2026-07-29. This asserts one hash rather than
 * a list of symptoms, so it catches any drift — including forms nobody has
 * thought of yet — instead of only the ones already seen.
 *
 * The clause directions in ADDITIONAL TERMS are deliberately opposite: a)/b)
 * *compel* retention of the author name, c)/d) *withhold* the brand (GPL §7(e)
 * and §7(c)). Never add a project or brand name to clause a) — it reads
 * naturally as "keep branding consistent" but would obligate every fork to
 * carry the brand, the exact opposite of reserving it.
 *
 * If this fails: do not edit LICENSE to satisfy the test. Copy the canonical
 * file from the landing-page repository, restore line 4 to this repo's URL, and
 * only update SUITE_LICENSE_BODY_SHA256 if the canonical itself changed
 * deliberately — in which case all nine repos need the same update.
